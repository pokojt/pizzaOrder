#Pizza Order

###By: Taylor Pokoj

##Description

For this project, we were instructed to create a website for a pizza company where a user can order a pizza and see the final cost. I used Object Oriented Javascript to:

- Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
- Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
- Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
